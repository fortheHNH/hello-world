I started the #100daysofcode challenge on 2020/11/05 and have been going strong every since!
I'm currently working on completing my Technical Documentation Page. This project is apart of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.
So far I've spent the past 32 days learning about HTML and CSS. I've completed a 4/5 projects. 
I've learned a lot in this short time and looking forward to completing my first certification.
I'm itchin' to get started with JavaScript afterwards.
